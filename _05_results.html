<h1>Results</h1>
<p>Due to the presence of two socioeconomic predictors in this analysis, a two pronged approach was used to evaluate each predictors impact on sports betting individually. Because of the limited knowledge of known sports-betting motivators, we felt this was the best approach considering the limited information available on the potential correlation of these factors. We split our work between education and income’s individual relationships with sports betting indicators to see the true results.</p>
<section id="statistical-thinking" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="statistical-thinking">Statistical Thinking</h2>
<p>To explore the potential correlation between sports betting activity and educational attainment, we applied statistical thinking by using a multiple linear regression model. Statistical thinking in this context allowed us to distill sports betting into a structured model that quantifies relationships between education level and betting activity, while also accounting for uncertainty. Naturally, this was the first step of our analysis and was primarily conducted as a validation to move forward with further analysis.</p>
<p>Our education model examined the relationship between the percentage of a state’s population at various education levels and the per capita sports betting revenue (<code>“rev_per_capita”</code>) using state-level data. The model included five predictor variables: percent of adults without a high school degree <code>hs_no_grad_pct</code>, high school graduates <code>hs_grad_pct</code>, associate degree holders <code>ass_pct</code>, bachelor’s degree holders <code>bach_pct</code>, and graduate or professional degree holders <code>grad_or_prof_pct</code>.The percentages were used rather than the actual numbers to avoid faulty results. Because we were working with fiscal data and population counts, if we did not scale it using percentages the model would have simply correlated higher populations with higher total handle.</p>

Figure 2: Linear model results comparing education rates to sport-betting handle in each state.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This modeling approach was appropriate for our research question because we sought to understand not just the presence of a relationship, but the strength and direction of influence that each educational level may exert on sports betting participation.</p>
<p>Linear regression allowed us to estimate how each education category contributes to variations in betting revenue. The results suggest that among all educational categories, only the proportion of bachelor’s degree holders (<code>bach_pct</code>) had a statistically significant relationship with sports betting revenue. Specifically, for every 1 percentage point increase in population of a state with bachelor’s degrees, we observed an estimated $5.60 increase in sports betting revenue per capita, controlling for all other education levels. This finding runs contrary to our initial hypothesis that lower educational attainment would be more strongly associated with increased betting activity. Other education categories, including high school dropouts and associate degree holders, showed no statistically significant effects on their own.</p>
<p>The model yielded a modest R-squared value of <strong>0.222</strong>, indicating that approximately <strong>22.2%</strong> of the variance in sports betting revenue per capita can be explained by educational attainment variables. This suggests other factors (such as income) are also influencing participation. These findings contribute to our broader research goal of identifying demographic predictors of betting participation. While the evidence does not fully support the assumption that lower educational attainment drives higher participation, the significance of the bachelor’s degree variable may point to a different trend; perhaps related to disposable income, cultural acceptability, or digital access among more educated populations.</p>
<p>To explore the potential correlation between income levels and sports betting activity, we applied statistical thinking by using multiple linear regression models. This approach allowed us to structure our data into a formal framework, quantify relationships between income metrics and sports betting participation, and assess the significance of each variable while controlling for others.</p>
<p>Given the complexity of socioeconomic factors and their possible overlap with population size, our income model incorporated both household count and income variables, using per-household normalization to avoid misleading conclusions driven by raw scale. Before modeling, we conducted a correlation analysis to evaluate the strength of linear relationships between income metrics and sports betting variables (see Figure 3). This preliminary step confirmed strong correlations between total households and both handle and revenue, as well as moderate correlations with income metrics.</p>

Figure 3: Correlation analysis exploring linear relationships between income and sportsbetting metrics where the biggest correlations across our data are between mean_income_dollars with handle or revenue.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Our analysis utilized state-level data and focused on three key predictors: mean income <code>mean_income_dollars</code>, median income <code>med_income_dollars</code>, and the total number of households <code>total_households</code>. We first modeled total sports betting handle as a function of these variables. As shown in Figure 3, the results indicated that all three predictors were relatively correlated. In particular, total households had the strongest relationship, with both revenue and handle suggesting a scaling effect. Mean income and median income had moderate correlation with both handle and revenue as well.</p>
<p>A high mean income coupled with a relatively lower median suggests a skewed distribution with a concentration of wealth among high earners. These individuals may be driving higher per-household betting revenue, either through discretionary spending or engagement with high-stakes platforms, skewing the overall picture. Based on</p>

<p>To refine this analysis, we created a normalized model using sports betting revenue per household <code>revenue_per_household</code> as the response variable. This adjustment removed the confounding influence of state population size and allowed us to better isolate the impact of income itself.</p>
<p>In this model (see Figure 4), mean income remained a significant positive predictor, with each additional dollar of mean income associated with a <strong>$0.0049</strong> increase in per-household betting revenue. Median income had a marginally significant negative association, potentially reflecting a skew in how wealth is distributed within states.</p>

Figure 4: Normalized linear models analyzing our key predictors relationship with handle and revenue.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The normalized model yielded an adjusted R-squared value of <strong>0.335</strong>, indicating that approximately <strong>33.5%</strong> of the variation in <code>revenue_per_household</code> can be explained by the two income variables. This represents a substantial improvement in explanatory power compared to models based solely on raw totals.</p>
<p>Compared to the unnormalized model predicting total handle, which explained only <strong>12.4%</strong> of the variance (adjusted R² = <strong>0.124</strong>), the normalized model’s adjusted R² of <strong>0.335</strong> indicates a substantial improvement. This suggests that per-household betting behavior is more systematically associated with income metrics than raw betting totals are.</p>
<p>Taken together, the findings suggest that states with higher mean income levels tend to see greater per-household betting participation, possibly due to increased disposable income or different spending behaviors among higher-income populations.</p>
<p>Conversely, the negative effect of median income may imply that income inequality, or the presence of high earners pulling up the mean, plays a more subtle role in shaping betting habits. This normalization is crucial because raw totals such as total handle or revenue are highly sensitive to population differences across states. Without adjustment, larger states would appear to have higher betting activity simply due to scale. By expressing revenue on a per-household basis, we focus the analysis on behavioral intensity rather than raw volume, making comparisons across states more meaningful.</p>
<p>These results complement our education analysis by highlighting that not only do demographic factors such as education level relate to sports betting behavior, but so do financial factors. Importantly, both analyses underscore the need to control for population size and distributional effects when modeling large-scale behavioral data such as gambling activity.</p>

<section id="data-visualization" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-visualization">Data Visualization</h2>
<p>Because our study investigates structural socioeconomic predictors of sports betting participation across U.S. states, visualization allowed us to explore spatial and demographic variation that would be obscured in a purely tabular or statistical summary. Each graphic was chosen and designed to make abstract trends in the data tangible. This was specifically helpful for our research question because of the twenty-six states that were relevant to our analysis. To evaluate education, we employed three types of visual techniques: grouped bar charts, choropleth maps, and bivariate scatterplots with linear models.</p>
<figure id="fig-mean_hand" class="figure">

Figure 5: Mean percentage of sports betting handle contributed by each region compared to their educational attainment rates.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This grouped bar chart was created to compare regional averages of sports betting contribution and educational attainment. Using regional grouping (Midwest, Northeast, South, and West) helped reduce state-level noise and highlight macro trends across large geographies. The decision to normalize state betting volume by national handle (rather than just raw values) allows for meaningful cross-region comparison despite population differences, as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Including education categories side-by-side reveals internal contrasts: for example, the South has the highest proportion of residents with only a high school diploma (<strong>16.4%</strong>) but a lower mean contribution to national sports betting handle (<strong>3.3%</strong>). Conversely, the West and Northeast show higher bachelor’s and graduate degree rates, and they also contribute disproportionately more to national handle. These visuals suggest that higher educational attainment may correlate with greater sports betting participation, a surprising and strong reversal of our original hypothesis.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To better understand geographic variance, we used choropleth maps to visualize state-level differences in both betting behavior and education attainment. Mapping handle per capita better reflects how intensely betting is occurring per resident rather than simply the sheer total. Pairing this map with a visualization of bachelor’s degree prevalence allowed us to visually test whether educational attainment is geographically co-located with higher levels of betting activity. We particularly chose to visualize bachelor’s degrees based on the results from the linear model, which weight bachelor’s degrees as having the highest impact on sports betting handle.</p>
<p>A noticeable feature of this graphic is that Northeastern states like New Jersey and New York stand out on both maps, high in handle per person and in bachelor’s degree rates, further supporting the idea that betting volume is not purely driven by economic desperation or low education levels. This falls in line with previous analysis from our region visualization showing higher betting contributions and education in the northeast.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To quantify the relationships suggested by our bar chart and map visualizations, we used scatterplots with fitted linear regression lines. This approach is effective for testing the direction and form of a relationship between two continuous variables; here, educational attainment percentage and percentage of national handle per state.</p>
<p>On the left, we see a negative correlation between the percentage of adults with only a high school diploma and their state’s betting contribution by residents. This challenges typical gambling trends that lower educational attainment drives betting behavior.</p>
<p>On the right, we observe a positive relationship between bachelor’s degree attainment and national handle share.</p>
<p>Ultimately, these visualizations further helped to debunk our hypothesis, instead, states with higher proportions of college-educated adults appear to participate more in sports betting, not less– a finding that would be difficult to identify through tables or regression coefficients alone.</p>
<p>To explore the relationship between income and sports betting participation across U.S. states, we used data visualizations to uncover patterns not immediately visible through numeric summaries or regression output. These visual tools helped us examine how both average and low-income populations relate to betting behavior, using a combination of scatterplots, choropleth maps, and faceted bar charts.</p>
<p>By incorporating both normalized and disaggregated income measures, we were able to contextualize betting activity within broader socioeconomic landscapes and challenge simplistic assumptions about gambling participation.</p>

Figure 8: State-level sports betting revenue per household vs mean income.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To assess the relationship between income and betting intensity, we created a scatterplot comparing mean household income to betting <code>revenue_per_household</code>. We chose to normalize betting revenue by the number of households in each state to control for population size. This can otherwise obscure behavioral trends in larger states. A positive linear trend emerged, suggesting that higher-income states tend to generate more betting <code>revenue_per_household</code>. This result challenges the common narrative that sports betting is driven primarily by economic desperation. This indicates instead that participation may be more prominent in higher-income populations with greater discretionary spending capacity.</p>

<p>To visualize geographic variation in income and betting simultaneously, we employed a pair of choropleth maps. The left-hand map displays normalized betting <code>revenue_per_household</code>, while the right-hand map shows the percentage of households earning under $35,000 annually (based on aggregated census income brackets).</p>
<p>These maps enable side-by-side comparison of betting intensity and economic hardship across states. Notably, states with higher concentrations of low-income households, such as Mississippi and West Virginia, tend to have lower per-household betting revenue. This reinforces the earlier observation that sports betting may not be concentrated in economically distressed regions, but rather in areas with a larger share of middle- and high-income households. This highlights outliers, such as states with modest income profiles but unexpectedly high betting activity, prompting further inquiry into regulatory differences, cultural norms, or marketing intensity as potential drivers.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To further interrogate the relationship between low-income prevalence and betting behavior, we plotted the percentage of low-income households in each state against the state’s total sports betting handle. This scatterplot revealed a moderate negative correlation, suggesting that states with larger proportions of low-income households tend to contribute less to national betting volume. While this may seem counterintuitive to some policy narratives, it aligns with economic theory suggesting that disposable income is a prerequisite for discretionary spending, including gambling.</p>

Figure 11: Household income distribution by bracket and betting revenue.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To further explore this relationship, we plotted the percentage of low-income households against total state betting handle. This scatterplot revealed a negative correlation, suggesting that states with more low-income households tend to contribute less to total national betting volume. Finally, we created a faceted bar chart displaying income distribution by bracket within each state, colored by betting revenue per capita. This visualization allowed us to examine intra-state income patterns and their correspondence with betting behavior.</p>
<p>States with greater proportions of middle- and upper-income brackets often also had higher per capita betting revenue, offering yet another lens into how income levels may facilitate or constrain sports betting activity. These visuals suggest that sports betting in the United States is not predominantly driven by poverty, but rather may be a behavior more concentrated among middle- and higher-income earners. This finding directly complicates common assumptions and reveals the value of visualizing normalized and disaggregated income data alongside betting metrics.</p>
<p>Our analysis underscores that betting participation could be shped less by financial distress and more by access, regulation, opportunity cost, or any other factors often underexplored in blanket narratives about gamblin behavior.</p>

<section id="machine-learning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h2>
<p>To complement our traditional statistical modeling and visualizations, we employed a Random Forest regression model to understand the relative importance of different education levels in predicting per capita sports betting activity. Machine learning models, particularly ensemble methods like Random Forests, are used for uncovering nonlinear relationships and interactions between variables that standard linear regression might miss. Linear models assume additive, independent relationships and normally distributed residuals; Random Forests handles nonlinear relationships and potential multicollinearity between education categories, which are likely correlated in real-world populations.</p>
<p>Our Random Forest model was built using the <code>randomForest</code> package in R. The outcome variable was <code>hand_percap</code> (sports betting handle per person in each state) and the predictors were the percentage of adults with each level of educational attainment: No high school diploma, High school diploma, Associate degree, Bachelor’s degree, and Graduate or professional degree. We trained the model with <code>importance = TRUE</code> to allow for feature importance analysis, helping us identify which variables contributed most to the prediction of sports betting handle.</p>
<p>From the linear model output, we observe that the coefficients suggest a strong positive relationship between bachelor’s degree attainment and betting per capita (<strong>+31.24</strong>), and a negative relationship with associate degree attainment (<strong>–27.86</strong>). These results somewhat mirror those found in our earlier multivariable regression, with new findings related to that of an associates degree. However, the true advantage of the Random Forest model lies in its ability to estimate variable importance without assuming linearity. Feature importance metrics reinforced that bachelor’s degree attainment was the most influential predictor of handle per capita. Other education levels such as high school diploma or graduate degrees showed lower importance scores, and associate degrees had an inverse relationship.</p>
<p>This convergence across one parametric model and one non-parametric model makes us confident that our findings are not artifacts of model structure or assumptions. In fact, Random Forest’s support for the same insight (the importance of bachelor’s degree prevalence) boosts our confidence that the relationship is meaningful and not merely coincidental or driven by outliers. Together with our regression model and visualization work, this machine learning analysis allows us to conclude that states with higher proportions of residents holding bachelor’s degrees tend to have higher sports betting participation per capita.</p>
<p>To complement our statistical regression analysis and further examine the relationship between income and sports betting activity, we applied both linear and logistic machine learning models using the <code>caret</code> package in R. These models provided different analytical lenses: regression for predicting a continuous outcome (<code>revenue_per_household</code> from sports betting), and classification for distinguishing between “high” and “low” sports betting states based on income variables. These approaches helped us assess whether income-related factors meaningfully predict betting participation, and whether such effects persist across model types.</p>
<p>We began by training a multiple linear regression model, using <code>revenue_per_household</code> as the continuous outcome. Predictor variables included <code>mean_income_dollars</code>, <code>med_income_dollars</code>, and <code>total_households</code>. This model allowed us to assess both the direction and strength of associations between income metrics and per-household betting activity. While total_households emerged as a statistically significant positive predictor (<strong>p = 0.018</strong>), the coefficients for both mean and median income were small and not significant, suggesting only a weak linear relationship between income levels and sports betting revenue at the state level. To evaluate predictive performance, we plotted actual versus predicted values for the linear model. Although the dashed 1:1 reference line provides a visual benchmark, the spread of points indicated moderate prediction accuracy. The model’s R² of <strong>0.39</strong> suggests that less than half of the variation in betting <code>revenue_per_household</code> can be explained by these three income-based predictors.</p>
<p>To explore the data from a different angle, we transformed the continuous outcome into a binary classification target. States were labeled “High” if their <code>revenue_per_household</code> exceeded the national median, and “Low” otherwise. We then trained a logistic regression model using the same three predictors. The goal was to assess how well income-related variables could distinguish between states with relatively high versus low sports betting intensity. The classification model achieved an overall accuracy of <strong>67.4%</strong>, significantly better than the no-information rate of <strong>50.6%</strong> (<strong>p = 0.001</strong>). Sensitivity and specificity were balanced at approximately <strong>66–69%</strong>, suggesting the model performed similarly well at identifying both high and low revenue states. Among the predictors, the number of households again stood out as significant (<strong>p = 0.0048</strong>), but median income also approached significance (<strong>p = 0.073</strong>), indicating a potential negative relationship with high betting participation.</p>
<p>The combination of these models reveals a consistent signal: income is not a particularly strong standalone predictor of sports betting participation, but total household count does show a consistent association. This could be reflecting structural factors like urbanization, market size, or marketing reach rather than income. Importantly, these results contrast with our findings on education, where the relationship with betting was both stronger and more interpretable. These machine learning models together help clarify that while income may play a role, it is not the dominant socioeconomic factor in predicting sports betting activity.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-ethics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-ethics">Data Ethics</h2>
<p>We used publicly available datasets from the U.S. Census and state-reported sports betting metrics. This approach minimized privacy risks, as no personally identifiable information (PII) was collected or processed at any stage of the analysis. Nevertheless, working with demographic and behavioral indicators, such as income, education, and gambling activity, still required caution. Even when data is de-identified, aggregation can lead to the reinforcement of stereotypes or the masking of structural inequities. To mitigate this risk, we chose to analyze only state-level trends, avoiding county- or zip-code-level disaggregation that could disproportionately spotlight or stigmatize smaller or more vulnerable populations; and we encourage future research into this sector to evaluate aggregated data as a precaution as well.</p>
<p>We were careful not to frame our findings in terms of moral judgment or individual responsibility, instead focusing on structural correlations and the potential for policy-level interventions. If future analysis were to consist of individual-level analysis, findings from that study could open the door to manipulative use of people’s data. For example, if a sports-betting company can predict an individual’s behavior associated with gambling, they can direct specialized ads and notifications to maximize handle from that user. This could lead to financial disturbance in that person’s life, especially if they already struggle with gambling habits.</p>
<p>Another ethical concern lies in bias baked into the original data sources. U.S. Census data, while comprehensive, has known limitations in how it categorizes income and education. It may undercount certain populations (especially undocumented individuals, rural residents, and Indigenous communities), which can skew representational accuracy. Sports betting data, on the other hand, only includes legal, reported activity, ignoring illegal or unregulated markets where participation may also be significant, particularly in states that have not legalized betting. This creates an incomplete picture of the true landscape and potentially biases our conclusions toward the behavior of more affluent, digitally connected populations who are more likely to use app-based platforms. Our analysis consisted of only 26 states, barely more than half of US states. While we prefaced this in our writing, if it were not properly disclosed it could lead to over-generalized assumptions about U.S. sports betting trends.</p>
<p>Lastly, we would like to recognize how our results could be interpreted, or misinterpreted, in public discourse. Gambling is a socially and politically charged topic, often laden with stigma. Suggesting that certain populations are more likely to gamble can quickly spiral into harmful narratives about irresponsibility or moral failing. Our aim was not to pathologize individuals, but to investigate structural patterns that may reflect underlying disparities in access, education, or economic opportunity. To that end, our findings are not meant to be deterministic conclusions, but rather context for further research and general awareness.</p>
