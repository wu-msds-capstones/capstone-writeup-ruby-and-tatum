# Background
Existing research on gambling behavior has long highlighted disparities in participation and harm across socioeconomic lines. Numerous studies have shown that individuals with lower income and education levels are more likely to engage in gambling activities and to experience gambling-related harm. These patterns suggest that gambling is often more than a recreational activity among vulnerable populations, but rather means for financial gain; driven by economic hardship or limited financial literacy., However, it is important to note that when these articles reference higher rates of gambling among lower incomes populations, it is often in reference to percentage of income; people with less income spend a higher percentage of their earnings on gambling compared to those with higher income. However, much of the existing literature focuses on traditional forms of gambling, such as casinos, lotteries, or scratch tickets, rather than sports betting, which has recently evolved due to mobile technologies and policy shifts. The legalization of sports betting across more than 30 U.S. states, coupled with app-based betting platforms, has introduced a new gambling ecosystem. Initial studies suggest that online sports bettors tend to skew younger and more male, and may differ in behavior and motivations from traditional gamblers.  

Because of the developing nature of this sector, studies have not examined how socioeconomic factors such as income or education level correlate to participation in sports betting to the same degree as studies on traditional gambling. This gap in the literature is significant given the rapid expansion of the sports betting industry and its integration into everyday digital life. Our study seeks to address this gap by examining correlations between fiscal sports betting data and state-level demographics, particularly educational attainment and income. By focusing on macro-level data across legalized states, we aim to identify whether historical socioeconomic disparities in gambling participation are mirrored in the newer domain of sports betting. If lower socioeconomic status is indeed linked to higher sports betting participation, this would suggest a need for proactive public health messaging and regulatory safeguards tailored to the unique risks of app-based platforms. Therefore, this study aims to reveal the correlation between sports gambling and socioeconomic factors with the hope to understand the predictors and if warnings or precautionary steps should be taken to prevent adverse effects to certain participants. While we hypothesize a positive correlation between these factors, our real hope is to deepen the understanding of this growing field to protect against misuse of the activity. While the language in this study is mostly general and common knowledge, there are a few vocabulary terms we would like to highlight here: 

Gambling: Gambling is the act of wagering something of value (usually money) on an event with an uncertain outcome, primarily for the purpose of winning additional money or material goods. It includes a wide range of activities such as lotteries, casino games, poker, and sports betting.
Sports Betting: Sports betting is a specific form of gambling in which individuals place wagers on the outcomes of sporting events. While sports betting can be done in person, the recent popularity of sports betting mobile apps, it has become one of the fastest-growing sectors of the gambling industry.
Handle: In the context of gambling, handle refers to the total amount of money wagered by bettors, regardless of whether the bets are won or lost. For example, a state's monthly sports betting handle reflects the gross volume of bets placed, not the revenue retained by operators or the winnings paid out.
