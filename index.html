<section id="introduction" class="level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Rapid legalization of gambling across the United States and the rise of app-based and online betting platforms, has propelled sports betting into a multi-billion-dollar industry. This transformation has introduced new forms of entertainment, economic opportunity, and athlete benefits, but it has also sparked critical questions about who participates in this growing industry and why. Specifically, are patterns of sports betting participation evenly distributed across demographic groups? And if not, which characteristics, such as education or income level, are most closely associated with higher betting activity?</p>
<p>Our hypothesis is that groups of lower socioeconomic status, with particular regards to income and education, would see higher rates of sports betting participation. Historically, gambling in general has been associated with lower-income and less-educated households. However, with sports betting being such a new venture in the gambling world, it is not widely associated with these socioeconomic trends yet. However, if these groups are in fact participating at a higher rate than others of higher socioeconomic standing, it raises concerns. For many individuals, gambling may reflect not recreational entertainment, but economic desperation, misinformed optimism, or a perceived path to financial mobility. In such contexts, the consequences of betting can deepen cycles of financial instability. At the same time, education levels may influence individuals’ understanding of risk, probability, and long-term outcomes, potentially creating an equity gap in financial decision-making and loss aversion.</p>
</section>
<section id="background" class="level1">
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Existing research on gambling behavior has long highlighted disparities in participation and harm across socioeconomic lines. Numerous studies have shown that individuals with lower income and education levels are more likely to engage in gambling activities and to experience gambling-related harm. These patterns suggest that gambling is often more than a recreational activity among vulnerable populations, but rather means for financial gain; driven by economic hardship or limited financial literacy. <span class="citation" data-cites="Williams2011">(<a href="#ref-Williams2011" role="doc-biblioref">Williams, Volberg, and Stevens 2011</a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Welte2004">(<a href="#ref-Welte2004" role="doc-biblioref">Welte et al. 2004</a>)</span> However, it is important to note that when these articles reference higher rates of gambling among lower incomes populations, it is often in reference to percentage of income; people with less income spend a higher percentage of their earnings on gambling compared to those with higher income.</p>
<p>Much of the existing literature focuses on traditional forms of gambling, such as casinos, lotteries, or scratch tickets, rather than sports betting, which has recently evolved due to mobile technologies and policy shifts. The legalization of sports betting across more than 30 U.S. states, coupled with app-based betting platforms, has introduced a new gambling ecosystem. Initial studies suggest that online sports bettors tend to skew younger and more male, and may differ in behavior and motivations from traditional gamblers. <span class="citation" data-cites="Volberg2010">(<a href="#ref-Volberg2010" role="doc-biblioref">Volberg, Nysse-Carris, and Gerstein 2010</a>)</span></p>
<p>Because of the developing nature of this sector, studies have not examined how socioeconomic factors such as income or education level correlate to participation in sports betting to the same degree as studies on traditional gambling. This gap in the literature is significant given the rapid expansion of the sports betting industry and its integration into everyday digital life.</p>
<p>Our study seeks to address this gap by examining correlations between fiscal sports betting data and state-level demographics, particularly educational attainment and income. By focusing on macro-level data across legalized states, we aim to identify whether historical socioeconomic disparities in gambling participation are mirrored in the newer domain of sports betting. If lower socioeconomic status is indeed linked to higher sports betting participation, this would suggest a need for proactive public health messaging and regulatory safeguards tailored to the unique risks of app-based platforms.</p>
<p>Therefore, this study aims to reveal the correlation between sports gambling and socioeconomic factors with the hope to understand the predictors and if warnings or precautionary steps should be taken to prevent adverse effects to certain participants. While we hypothesize a positive correlation between these factors, our real hope is to deepen the understanding of this growing field to protect against misuse of the activity. While the language in this study is mostly general and common knowledge, there are a few vocabulary terms we would like to highlight here:</p>
<p><strong>Gambling:</strong> Gambling is the act of wagering something of value (usually money) on an event with an uncertain outcome, primarily for the purpose of winning additional money or material goods. It includes a wide range of activities such as lotteries, casino games, poker, and sports betting.</p>
<p><strong>Sports Betting:</strong> Sports betting is a specific form of gambling in which individuals place wagers on the outcomes of sporting events. While sports betting can be done in person, the recent popularity of sports betting mobile apps, it has become one of the fastest-growing sectors of the gambling industry.</p>
<p><strong>Handle:</strong> In the context of gambling, handle refers to the total amount of money wagered by bettors, regardless of whether the bets are won or lost. For example, a state’s monthly sports betting handle reflects the gross volume of bets placed, not the revenue retained by operators or the winnings paid out.</p>
</section>
<section id="data" class="level1">
<h1>Data</h1>
<p>The goal of this project being to investigate the correlation between sports betting rates and education/income trends across U.S. states, we collected and compiled data from multiple sources. The first dataset, titled Online Sports Betting Dataset, was the most straightforward. This data was retrieved via download directly from rg.org/statistics/us. In contrast, collecting income and education data from the U.S. Census (covering the years 2018–2023) proved more complex. The range from 2018-2023 was selected because it represents the overlap of available years across all relevant datasets. However, due to the structure of the Census API, each year and state combination required a unique API. Additionally, the topic parameter (either income or education) had to be specified separately. This meant that retrieving data for all 50 states across six years, for two topics, would have required 384 manual downloads and subsequent joins. To avoid this, we built a web scraper using Docker, Supabase, PostgreSQL, and Beekeeper Studio. The scraper looped through the <code>year</code> and <code>GeoID</code> values in the API URL to pull each required combination in one run. However, we opted to run the scraper twice, once for income and once for education, manually replacing the topic ID in the <code>scraper.py</code> file between runs, rather than building the scraper to run both topics. The logic behind this decision was that it was simpler to change one number in the <code>scraper.py</code> file and run it a second time, than create a scraper that switched which table it was dumping into halfway through, since storing education and income in two individual tables was better for the planned analysis.</p>
<p>Once scraped, we employed SQL to clean and normalize the raw JSON responses into tabular CSV format. Rather than storing all columns from the original census datasets, we selected only the variables relevant to our analysis. This process resulted in three final tables: the sports betting dataset, the cleaned income dataset, and the cleaned education dataset, all of which were stored on local systems for the remainder of the project. For each dataset, we performed several operations to ensure consistency across columns and formats. We first conducted basic data cleaning and wrangling where the column values and names were altered to be consistent among all the data. The next step was finding a common variable among our three datasets. <code>Geoid</code> and <code>year</code> became our primary identifiers across our sports betting, cleaned income, and cleaned education datasets. This also allowed for simple screening for duplicates among the tables that may have the same geoid and year, and we were able to filter those out quickly. We created a location table that showed the corresponding state name to each geoID, which worked as a connection between all tables. After that we normalized the data structure in a way we believed was efficient for our planned analysis, see ERD below.</p>

</figure>
<p>As seen above, to support analysis of the relationship between sports betting activity and socioeconomic trends across U.S. states, the data was structured into a schema that separates income, education, and betting metrics into connected tables to facilitate flexible joins. <code>Geoid</code> and <code>year</code> serve as foreign keys linking all domain-specific tables (income, education, and sports betting) to the central location table that maps each geoid to a state-level place_name. Income data is organized into two fact tables. The income_distribution table captures the percentage of households within each income bracket and household type, while the income_summary table provides metrics such as total households, median income, and mean income by household type. These reference the income_brackets and household_type dimension tables for consistency. Education data is stored in the edu_long table, which reports the number of individuals by education level and age group. It joins the age_group_map table to normalize age categories. Sports betting data is stored in clean_sports, which contains metrics such as handle, revenue, hold, and taxes. This table integrates with the rest of the schema via shared identifiers. This structure allows for efficient querying as we explore the research question.</p>

<p>Due to the presence of two socioeconomic predictors in this analysis, a two pronged approach was used to evaluate each predictors impact on sports betting individually. Because of the limited knowledge of known sports-betting motivators, we felt this was the best approach considering the limited information available on the potential correlation of these factors.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="statistical-thinking">Statistical Thinking</h2>
<p>To explore the potential correlation between sports betting activity and educational attainment, we applied statistical thinking by using a multiple linear regression model. Statistical thinking in this context allowed us to distill sports betting into a structured model that quantifies relationships between education level and betting activity, while also accounting for uncertainty. Naturally, this was the first step of our analysis and was primarily conducted as a validation to move forward with further analysis. Our education model examined the relationship between the percentage of a state’s population at various education levels and the per capita sports betting revenue (“rev_per_capita”) using state-level data. The model included five predictor variables: percent of adults without a high school degree <code>hs_no_grad_pct</code>, high school graduates <code>hs_grad_pct</code>, associate degree holders <code>ass_pct</code>, bachelor’s degree holders <code>bach_pct</code>, and graduate or professional degree holders <code>grad_or_prof_pct</code>.The percentages were used rather than the actual numbers to avoid faulty results. Because we were working with fiscal data and population counts, if we did not scale it using percentages the model would have simply correlated higher populations with higher total handle.</p>

</figure>
<p>This modeling approach was appropriate for our research question because we sought to understand not just the presence of a relationship, but the strength and direction of influence that each educational level may exert on sports betting participation. Linear regression allowed us to estimate how each education category contributes to variations in betting revenue. The results suggest that among all educational categories, only the proportion of bachelor’s degree holders (<code>bach_pct</code>) had a statistically significant relationship with sports betting revenue. Specifically, for every 1 percentage point increase in population of a state with bachelor’s degrees, we observed an estimated $5.60 increase in sports betting revenue per capita, controlling for all other education levels. This finding runs contrary to our initial hypothesis that lower educational attainment would be more strongly associated with increased betting activity. Other education categories, including high school dropouts and associate degree holders, showed no statistically significant effects on their own.</p>
<p>The model yielded a modest R-squared value of 0.222, indicating that approximately 22.2% of the variance in sports betting revenue per capita can be explained by educational attainment variables. This suggests other factors (such as income) are also influencing participation. These findings contribute to our broader research goal of identifying demographic predictors of betting participation. While the evidence does not fully support the assumption that lower educational attainment drives higher participation, the significance of the bachelor’s degree variable may point to a different trend; perhaps related to disposable income, cultural acceptability, or digital access among more educated populations.</p>
<p>To explore the potential correlation between income levels and sports betting activity, we applied statistical thinking by using multiple linear regression models. This approach allowed us to structure our data into a formal framework, quantify relationships between income metrics and sports betting participation, and assess the significance of each variable while controlling for others. Given the complexity of socioeconomic factors and their possible overlap with population size, our income model incorporated both household count and income variables, using per-household normalization to avoid misleading conclusions driven by raw scale. Before modeling, we conducted a correlation analysis to evaluate the strength of linear relationships between income metrics and sports betting variables (see image). This preliminary step confirmed strong correlations between total households and both handle and revenue, as well as moderate correlations with income metrics.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Our analysis utilized state-level data and focused on three key predictors: mean income <code>mean_income_dollars</code>, median income <code>med_income_dollars</code>, and the total number of households <code>total_households</code>. We first modeled total sports betting handle as a function of these variables. As shown in Figure Y, the results indicated that all three predictors were statistically significant. In particular, total households had the strongest relationship, with each additional household associated with an estimated $1,276 increase in total handle, suggesting a scale effect. Mean income had a positive effect, while median income had a negative effect, though both were smaller in magnitude. This comparison between mean and median income effects may point toward the role of income inequality. A high mean income coupled with a relatively lower median suggests a skewed distribution with a concentration of wealth among high earners. These individuals may be driving higher per-household betting revenue, either through discretionary spending or engagement with high-stakes platforms, skewing the overall picture.To refine this analysis, we created a normalized model using sports betting revenue per household <code>revenue_per_household</code> as the response variable. This adjustment removed the confounding influence of state population size and allowed us to better isolate the impact of income itself. In this model (see Figure ), mean income remained a significant positive predictor, with each additional dollar of mean income associated with a $0.0049 increase in per-household betting revenue. Median income had a marginally significant negative association, potentially reflecting a skew in how wealth is distributed within states.</p>

Figure 2c: Normalized linear models analyzing our key predictors relationship with handle and revenue.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The normalized model yielded an adjusted R-squared value of 0.335, indicating that approximately 33.5% of the variation in revenue per household can be explained by the two income variables. This represents a substantial improvement in explanatory power compared to models based solely on raw totals. Compared to the unnormalized model predicting total handle, which explained only 12.4% of the variance (adjusted R² = 0.124), the normalized model’s adjusted R² of 0.335 indicates a substantial improvement. This suggests that per-household betting behavior is more systematically associated with income metrics than raw betting totals are. Taken together, the findings suggest that states with higher mean income levels tend to see greater per-household betting participation, possibly due to increased disposable income or different spending behaviors among higher-income populations.</p>
<p>Conversely, the negative effect of median income may imply that income inequality, or the presence of high earners pulling up the mean, plays a more subtle role in shaping betting habits. This normalization is crucial because raw totals such as total handle or revenue are highly sensitive to population differences across states. Without adjustment, larger states would appear to have higher betting activity simply due to scale. By expressing revenue on a per-household basis, we focus the analysis on behavioral intensity rather than raw volume, making comparisons across states more meaningful. These results complement our education analysis by highlighting that not only do demographic factors such as education level relate to sports betting behavior, but so do financial factors. Importantly, both analyses underscore the need to control for population size and distributional effects when modeling large-scale behavioral data such as gambling activity.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-visualization">Data Visualization</h2>
<p>Because our study investigates structural socioeconomic predictors of sports betting participation across U.S. states, visualization allowed us to explore spatial and demographic variation that would be obscured in a purely tabular or statistical summary. Each graphic was chosen and designed to make abstract trends in the data tangible. This was specifically helpful for our research question because of the twenty-six states that were relevant to our analysis. To evaluate education, we employed three types of visual techniques: grouped bar charts, choropleth maps, and bivariate scatterplots with linear models.</p>
<figure id="fig-mean_hand" class="figure">

Figure 3a: Mean percentage of sports betting handle contributed by each region compared to their educational attainment rates.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This grouped bar chart was created to compare regional averages of sports betting contribution and educational attainment. Using regional grouping (Midwest, Northeast, South, and West) helped reduce state-level noise and highlight macro trends across large geographies. The decision to normalize state betting volume by national handle (rather than just raw values) allows for meaningful cross-region comparison despite population differences, as mentioned earlier. Including education categories side-by-side reveals internal contrasts: for example, the South has the highest proportion of residents with only a high school diploma (16.4%) but a lower mean contribution to national sports betting handle (3.3%). Conversely, the West and Northeast show higher bachelor’s and graduate degree rates, and they also contribute disproportionately more to national handle. These visuals suggest that higher educational attainment may correlate with greater sports betting participation, a surprising and strong reversal of our original hypothesis.</p>

</figure>
<p>To better understand geographic variance, we used choropleth maps to visualize state-level differences in both betting behavior and education attainment. Mapping handle per capita better reflects how intensely betting is occurring per resident rather than simply the sheer total. Pairing this map with a visualization of bachelor’s degree prevalence allowed us to visually test whether educational attainment is geographically co-located with higher levels of betting activity. We particularly chose to visualize bachelor’s degrees based on the results from the linear model, which weight bachelor’s degrees as having the highest impact on sports betting handle. A noticeable feature of this graphic is that Northeastern states like New Jersey and New York stand out on both maps, high in handle per person and in bachelor’s degree rates, further supporting the idea that betting volume is not purely driven by economic desperation or low education levels. This falls in line with previous analysis from our region visualization showing higher betting contributions and education in the northeast.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To quantify the relationships suggested by our bar chart and map visualizations, we used scatterplots with fitted linear regression lines. This approach is effective for testing the direction and form of a relationship between two continuous variables; here, educational attainment percentage and percentage of national handle per state. On the left, we see a negative correlation between the percentage of adults with only a high school diploma and their state’s betting contribution by residents. This challenges typical gambling trends that lower educational attainment drives betting behavior. On the right, we observe a positive relationship between bachelor’s degree attainment and national handle share. Ultimately, these visualizations further helped to debunk our hypothesis, instead, states with higher proportions of college-educated adults appear to participate more in sports betting, not less– a finding that would be difficult to identify through tables or regression coefficients alone.</p>
<p>To explore the relationship between income and sports betting participation across U.S. states, we used data visualizations to uncover patterns not immediately visible through numeric summaries or regression output. These visual tools helped us examine how both average and low-income populations relate to betting behavior, using a combination of scatterplots, choropleth maps, and faceted bar charts. By incorporating both normalized and disaggregated income measures, we were able to contextualize betting activity within broader socioeconomic landscapes and challenge simplistic assumptions about gambling participation.</p>

Figure 3d: State-level sports betting revenue per household vs mean income.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To assess the relationship between income and betting intensity, we created a scatterplot comparing mean household income to betting revenue per household. We chose to normalize betting revenue by the number of households in each state to control for population size. This can otherwise obscure behavioral trends in larger states. A positive linear trend emerged, suggesting that higher-income states tend to generate more betting revenue per household. This result challenges the common narrative that sports betting is driven primarily by economic desperation. This indicates instead that participation may be more prominent in higher-income populations with greater discretionary spending capacity.</p>

</figure>
<p>To visualize geographic variation in income and betting simultaneously, we employed a pair of choropleth maps. The left-hand map displays normalized betting revenue per household, while the right-hand map shows the percentage of households earning under $35,000 annually (based on aggregated census income brackets). These maps enable side-by-side comparison of betting intensity and economic hardship across states. Notably, states with higher concentrations of low-income households, such as Mississippi and West Virginia, tend to have lower per-household betting revenue. This reinforces the earlier observation that sports betting may not be concentrated in economically distressed regions, but rather in areas with a larger share of middle- and high-income households. This highlights outliers, such as states with modest income profiles but unexpectedly high betting activity, prompting further inquiry into regulatory differences, cultural norms, or marketing intensity as potential drivers.</p>

Figure 3f: Sports betting handle vs % low-income households.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To further interrogate the relationship between low-income prevalence and betting behavior, we plotted the percentage of low-income households in each state against the state’s total sports betting handle. This scatterplot revealed a moderate negative correlation, suggesting that states with larger proportions of low-income households tend to contribute less to national betting volume. While this may seem counterintuitive to some policy narratives, it aligns with economic theory suggesting that disposable income is a prerequisite for discretionary spending, including gambling.</p>

Figure 3g: Household income distribution by bracket and betting revenue.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To further explore this relationship, we plotted the percentage of low-income households against total state betting handle. This scatterplot revealed a negative correlation, suggesting that states with more low-income households tend to contribute less to total national betting volume. Finally, we created a faceted bar chart displaying income distribution by bracket within each state, colored by betting revenue per capita. This visualization allowed us to examine intra-state income patterns and their correspondence with betting behavior. States with greater proportions of middle- and upper-income brackets often also had higher per capita betting revenue, offering yet another lens into how income levels may facilitate or constrain sports betting activity. These visuals suggest that sports betting in the United States is not predominantly driven by poverty, but rather may be a behavior more concentrated among middle- and higher-income earners. This finding directly complicates common assumptions and reveals the value of visualizing normalized and disaggregated income data alongside betting metrics. Our analysis underscores that betting participation could be shped less by financial distress and more by access, regulation, opportunity cost, or any other factors often underexplored in blanket narratives about gamblin behavior.</p>

<section id="machine-learning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h2>
<p>To complement our traditional statistical modeling and visualizations, we employed a Random Forest regression model to understand the relative importance of different education levels in predicting per capita sports betting activity. Machine learning models, particularly ensemble methods like Random Forests, are used for uncovering nonlinear relationships and interactions between variables that standard linear regression might miss. Linear models assume additive, independent relationships and normally distributed residuals; Random Forests handles nonlinear relationships and potential multicollinearity between education categories, which are likely correlated in real-world populations.</p>
<p>Our Random Forest model was built using the <code>randomForest</code> package in R. The outcome variable was <code>hand_percap</code> (sports betting handle per person in each state) and the predictors were the percentage of adults with each level of educational attainment: No high school diploma, High school diploma, Associate degree, Bachelor’s degree, and Graduate or professional degree. We trained the model with <code>importance = TRUE</code> to allow for feature importance analysis, helping us identify which variables contributed most to the prediction of sports betting handle.</p>
<figure id="fig-edu_ml" class="figure">

<figcaption style="font-size: 8px; color: #555;">
Figure 4a: Results from randomForest model comparing education rates to handle per resident in U.S. States.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>From the linear model output (shown alongside the Random Forest code), we observe that the coefficients suggest a strong positive relationship between bachelor’s degree attainment and betting per capita (+31.24), and a negative relationship with associate degree attainment (–27.86). These results somewhat mirror those found in our earlier multivariable regression, with new findings related to that of an associates degree. However, the true advantage of the Random Forest model lies in its ability to estimate variable importance without assuming linearity. Feature importance metrics reinforced that bachelor’s degree attainment was the most influential predictor of handle per capita. Other education levels such as high school diploma or graduate degrees showed lower importance scores, and associate degrees had an inverse relationship.</p>
<p>This convergence across one parametric model and one non-parametric model makes us confident that our findings are not artifacts of model structure or assumptions. In fact, Random Forest’s support for the same insight (the importance of bachelor’s degree prevalence) boosts our confidence that the relationship is meaningful and not merely coincidental or driven by outliers. Together with our regression model and visualization work, this machine learning analysis allows us to conclude that states with higher proportions of residents holding bachelor’s degrees tend to have higher sports betting participation per capita.</p>
<p>To complement our statistical regression analysis and further examine the relationship between income and sports betting activity, we applied both linear and logistic machine learning models using the caret package in R. These models provided different analytical lenses: regression for predicting a continuous outcome (revenue per household from sports betting), and classification for distinguishing between “high” and “low” sports betting states based on income variables. These approaches helped us assess whether income-related factors meaningfully predict betting participation, and whether such effects persist across model types.</p>
<p>We began by training a multiple linear regression model, using revenue_per_household as the continuous outcome. Predictor variables included mean_income_dollars, med_income_dollars, and total_households. This model allowed us to assess both the direction and strength of associations between income metrics and per-household betting activity. While total_households emerged as a statistically significant positive predictor (p = 0.018), the coefficients for both mean and median income were small and not significant, suggesting only a weak linear relationship between income levels and sports betting revenue at the state level. To evaluate predictive performance, we plotted actual versus predicted values for the linear model. Although the dashed 1:1 reference line provides a visual benchmark, the spread of points indicated moderate prediction accuracy. The model’s R^2 of 0.39 suggests that less than half of the variation in betting revenue per household can be explained by these three income-based predictors.</p>

Figure 4b: Linear regression predictions versus actual revenue per household.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To explore the data from a different angle, we transformed the continuous outcome into a binary classification target. States were labeled “High” if their revenue per household exceeded the national median, and “Low” otherwise. We then trained a logistic regression model using the same three predictors. The goal was to assess how well income-related variables could distinguish between states with relatively high versus low sports betting intensity. The classification model achieved an overall accuracy of 67.4%, significantly better than the no-information rate of 50.6% (p = 0.001). Sensitivity and specificity were balanced at approximately 66–69%, suggesting the model performed similarly well at identifying both high and low revenue states. Among the predictors, the number of households again stood out as significant (p = 0.0048), but median income also approached significance (p = 0.073), indicating a potential negative relationship with high betting participation.</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The combination of these models reveals a consistent signal: income is not a particularly strong standalone predictor of sports betting participation, but total household count does show a consistent association. This could be reflecting structural factors like urbanization, market size, or marketing reach rather than income. Importantly, these results contrast with our findings on education, where the relationship with betting was both stronger and more interpretable. These machine learning models together help clarify that while income may play a role, it is not the dominant socioeconomic factor in predicting sports betting activity.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-ethics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-ethics">Data Ethics</h2>
<p>We used publicly available datasets from the U.S. Census and state-reported sports betting metrics. This approach minimized privacy risks, as no personally identifiable information (PII) was collected or processed at any stage of the analysis. Nevertheless, working with demographic and behavioral indicators, such as income, education, and gambling activity, still required caution. Even when data is de-identified, aggregation can lead to the reinforcement of stereotypes or the masking of structural inequities. To mitigate this risk, we chose to analyze only state-level trends, avoiding county- or zip-code-level disaggregation that could disproportionately spotlight or stigmatize smaller or more vulnerable populations; and we encourage future research into this sector to evaluate aggregated data as a precaution as well. We were careful not to frame our findings in terms of moral judgment or individual responsibility, instead focusing on structural correlations and the potential for policy-level interventions. If future analysis were to consist of individual-level analysis, findings from that study could open the door to manipulative use of people’s data. For example, if a sports-betting company can predict an individual’s behavior associated with gambling, they can direct specialized ads and notifications to maximize handle from that user. This could lead to financial disturbance in that person’s life, especially if they already struggle with gambling habits.</p>
<p>Another ethical concern lies in bias baked into the original data sources. U.S. Census data, while comprehensive, has known limitations in how it categorizes income and education. It may undercount certain populations (especially undocumented individuals, rural residents, and Indigenous communities), which can skew representational accuracy. Sports betting data, on the other hand, only includes legal, reported activity, ignoring illegal or unregulated markets where participation may also be significant, particularly in states that have not legalized betting. This creates an incomplete picture of the true landscape and potentially biases our conclusions toward the behavior of more affluent, digitally connected populations who are more likely to use app-based platforms. Our analysis consisted of only 26 states, barely more than half of US states. While we prefaced this in our writing, if it were not properly disclosed it could lead to over-generalized assumptions about U.S. sports betting trends.</p>
<p>Lastly, we would like to recognize how our results could be interpreted, or misinterpreted, in public discourse. Gambling is a socially and politically charged topic, often laden with stigma. Suggesting that certain populations are more likely to gamble can quickly spiral into harmful narratives about irresponsibility or moral failing. Our aim was not to pathologize individuals, but to investigate structural patterns that may reflect underlying disparities in access, education, or economic opportunity. To that end, our findings are not meant to be deterministic conclusions, but rather context for further research and general awareness.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="conclusions" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>This project set out to investigate whether socioeconomic indicators, specifically education and income, could help explain variations in sports betting participation across U.S. states. Our initial hypothesis, informed by patterns observed in traditional gambling literature, assumed that individuals with lower education and income levels would participate more heavily in sports betting. However, our findings revealed a more nuanced picture. Education emerged as a particularly important factor, though not in the way we expected. Rather than lower educational attainment predicting greater sports betting activity, our analysis identified an increase in sport-betting activities with higher education levels, specifically bachelor’s degree attainment as the strongest predictor of increased per capita betting. This suggests that sports betting, especially in its app-based form, may appeal more to college-educated individuals; perhaps due to factors like digital fluency, marketing exposure, cultural normalization and the increased disposable income most bachelor’s degree holders have, which leads us to the trends we saw in our income section.</p>
<p>While mean income had a modest positive association with betting revenue per household, total household count showed stronger predictive value. This may reflect structural factors such as population density rather than individual financial behavior. Contrary to narratives that link gambling primarily to financial desperation, our analysis suggests that disposable income may be more relevant to understanding who participates in legal sports betting. Taken together, these results complicate traditional assumptions about gambling behavior. They show that sports betting, as a modern and heavily marketed phenomenon, interacts with socioeconomic indicators differently than casinos or lotteries have in the past. In particular, lower educational attainment may correlate with lower income and thus less disposable cash.</p>
<p>Ultimately, although we negated our original hypothesis, we believe our findings contribute a valuable dimension to public policy and risk regulation discourse. By identifying education and income as meaningful predictors, we hope to support more targeted and equitable safeguards, ones that recognize the diversity of participation across the socioeconomic spectrum rather than relying on outdated generalizations. Future work on this topic should expand the scope of variables under consideration, perhaps incorporating additional census metrics such as race, age, employment type, or urbanization. It would also be useful to compare socioeconomic predictors of traditional gambling versus sports betting, to determine whether the evolving landscape of legal gambling requires a rethinking of regulatory assumptions. As this industry grows, understanding who is participating, and why, is essential to preventing harm and ensuring that gambling is done seeking entertainment rather than desperation.</p>
