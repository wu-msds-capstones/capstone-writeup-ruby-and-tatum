# Conclusions

This project set out to investigate whether socioeconomic indicators, specifically education and income, could help explain variations in sports betting participation across U.S. states. Our initial hypothesis, informed by patterns observed in traditional gambling literature, assumed that individuals with lower education and income levels would participate more heavily in sports betting. However, our findings revealed a more nuanced picture. Education emerged as a particularly important factor, though not in the way we expected. Rather than lower educational attainment predicting greater sports betting activity, our analysis identified an increase in sport-betting activities with higher education levels, specifically bachelor's degree attainment as the strongest predictor of increased per capita betting. This suggests that sports betting, especially in its app-based form, may appeal more to college-educated individuals; perhaps due to factors like digital fluency, marketing exposure, cultural normalization and the increased disposable income most bachelor's degree holders have, which leads us to the trends we saw in our income section.

While mean income had a modest positive association with betting revenue per household, total household count showed stronger predictive value. This may reflect structural factors such as population density rather than individual financial behavior. Contrary to narratives that link gambling primarily to financial desperation, our analysis suggests that disposable income may be more relevant to understanding who participates in legal sports betting. Taken together, these results complicate traditional assumptions about gambling behavior. They show that sports betting, as a modern and heavily marketed phenomenon, interacts with socioeconomic indicators differently than casinos or lotteries have in the past. In particular, lower educational attainment may correlate with lower income and thus less disposable cash.

Ultimately, although we negated our original hypothesis, we believe our findings contribute a valuable dimension to public policy and risk regulation discourse. By identifying education and income as meaningful predictors, we hope to support more targeted and equitable safeguards, ones that recognize the diversity of participation across the socioeconomic spectrum rather than relying on outdated generalizations. Future work on this topic should expand the scope of variables under consideration, perhaps incorporating additional census metrics such as race, age, employment type, or urbanization. It would also be useful to compare socioeconomic predictors of traditional gambling versus sports betting, to determine whether the evolving landscape of legal gambling requires a rethinking of regulatory assumptions. As this industry grows, understanding who is participating, and why, is essential to preventing harm and ensuring that gambling is done seeking entertainment rather than desperation.
